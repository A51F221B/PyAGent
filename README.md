# PyAGent
## Note : This project is still underdevelopment, you are more than welcome to contribute
### The idea behind this project is to send user keylogs to your Twitter DMs ! All you need is access to twitter API secret keys and token.
### To use this script you have to add those keys. Also keep in mind that some of the functions are not called. I will work on it further
